Data Science Project

This repository contains two data science projects designed to apply practical skills in data cleaning, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. The goal is to simulate real-world workflows using Python and build hands-on experience with realistic data challenges.

Contents

1. Absenteeism Analysis

This project analyzes workplace absenteeism data to uncover patterns and predict excessive absenteeism. It emphasizes proper data preparation and feature selection to extract meaningful insights.

Key tasks:
- Cleaning and preprocessing raw data
- Feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Building a basic predictive logic model

Notebook: Absenteeism.ipynb

2. Data Visualization Projects

A collection of Jupyter notebooks focused on developing core visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Various chart types are used to effectively communicate insights from structured datasets.

Directory: data-visualization-projects  
Notebooks included:
- Bar Chart.ipynb
- Line Chart.ipynb
- Pie Chart.ipynb
- Histogram.ipynb
- Scatter Plot.ipynb
- Scatter.ipynb
- Stacked Area Chart.ipynb
- Bar and Line Chart.ipynb

Tools and Libraries

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Skills Demonstrated

- Python programming
- Data manipulation with Pandas and NumPy
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Handling real-world, imperfect datasets

About the Projects

These projects were created as part of a practical learning journey, inspired by industry-focused training materials from 365 Careers. The aim is to go beyond simplified examples by working with unrefined data and developing analysis workflows that reflect professional data analyst responsibilities.
