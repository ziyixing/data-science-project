Data Science Project

Welcome to the data-science-project repository. This repository contains hands-on projects that demonstrate core data analysis and visualization skills. Each project simulates real-world tasks to help build practical experience in working with messy datasets, cleaning and preprocessing data, and communicating insights effectively.
Contents
1. Absenteeism Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing workplace absenteeism data to uncover patterns and predict excessive absenteeism.

Key components:

    Data cleaning and preprocessing

    Feature engineering

    Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

    Simple predictive logic

About This Repository

These projects were developed as part of a practical data analyst training program inspired by 365 Careers. The course emphasizes end-to-end workflows and real-world datasets rather than simplified exercises with pre-cleaned data.
